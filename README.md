# Kaboom Intro Game
This repository contains the sprites and scripts to build a basic introductory game using Kaboom.Js v3000

The game is built using Google Apps Script and deployed as a WebApp.  In order to do so, 4 files are created:  
- Code.gs
- index.html
- css.html
- js.html

The Kaboom code is all written within the js.html file.  Sprites for the game are located in the Game_Sprites folder.
