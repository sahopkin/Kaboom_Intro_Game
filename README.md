# Kaboom_Intro_Game
This repository contains the sprites and scripts to build a basic introductory game using Kaboom.Js v3000

The game is built using Google Apps Script and deployed as a WebApp.  In order to do so, 4 files are created:  Code.gs, index.html, css.html, and js.html.  The Kaboom code is all written within the js.html file.
